/**
 * The observer api allows a publisher/subscriber modification of an subject/observer pattern. Instead of registering observers directly at subjects, the api provides a delegate object 
 * which allows a decoupling between subjects and observers, and allows multiple third-objects to fire events for a subject.
 * Another difference between this api and the publisher/subscriber model is that the event issuer (i.e. subject) is actually blocked until the event is delivered to all observers.
 * Further, the API makes different methods for a user and the current user, the later allowing my-methods in the api to alter caches (since they are called in the context of the user's session).
